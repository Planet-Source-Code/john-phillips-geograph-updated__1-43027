This Latitude / Longitude mapping system can be useful for many applications. such as a GSP Locator, or IP host resolution. It isn't complete yet but I am getting there. I have added the IP Address resoultion / host name resolution. it is working on most IP's Hostname in the US - I have not added international support yet. there is a lot of Whois Servers to qeury and at the moment this only queries one of them, I am adding more servers as you read this :) - I would also like to thank John Kapili - he has been e-mailing me today and has given me some great ideas - and also provided me with links to some great maps, that i am currently working on to get it into GeoGraph. I will be updating this application again soon, I should have some free time this weekend to work on it. have fun and enjoy, also keep in mind, since i am only using 1 whois server at this point, making to many queries to a whois server in 1 day sometime warrents them to block your IP address from accessing thier server, so try to take it easy, I did make over 100 queries while testing this app and I still haven't been blocked yet, so I am not sure what the cut off is.

If you have any problems with this application please let me know, I would like to know about them. You can email me at: vbjack@nyc.rr.com. Also please vote if you like this code.

PS There are still a few minor bugs tha I am working on, I will have them fixed also with the next updat - if you do find any bugs please let me know ASAP so i can fix them, Thanx
